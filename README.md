# Wine_Quality_Prediction
A machine learning project to predict red wine quality based on physicochemical features. Using a Random Forest Classifier, the model classifies wines by quality score, demonstrating data-driven approaches in product assessment.
# Wine Quality Prediction 🍷

This project builds a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical features using a Random Forest Classifier.

## 🔍 Overview
The dataset includes various chemical measurements of wine samples. Our task is to classify the quality of wine, which is given as a score between 0 and 10.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

## 📁 Dataset
Wine Quality dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository (commonly used red wine version).

## 📈 Model
We train a Random Forest Classifier after visualizing and understanding the distribution of key features. The model is evaluated using accuracy.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
